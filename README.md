To teach not only how to create Animations on the web, but why and when.

**Content Lead: Alyssa Nicoll; Content Reviewer: Jon Friskics**

## This course for web animations will consists of the following main concepts:

* [Transitions](levels/transitions/title.md)
* [Transforms](levels/transform/title.md)
* [Keyframe](levels/keyframe/title.md)
* [SVG](levels/svg/title.md)

### Each Section, for the most part, should follow this pattern:

1. Title

  The title of the course.

2. Welcome (optional)

  Welcome people to the course, introduce yourself.

3. History (optional)

  If needed, can give a history of where ____ came from, how it got started, why we are using it now.

4. Final State of App

  Start the course off by showing what you are going to create by the end. Explain the app at a very high level and click through it a bit. If this is not the first section, then here is where you often will show the **state of the app where we left off**.

5. Problem

  Sometimes a problem is lengthy and a **list of steps** is needed. **Mini problems** also sometimes sprout during this phase of a section.

6. Solution

7. Concept (optional)

  Used when the problem is complicated enough that showing it at the conceptual level would be helpful for students to understand what's going on.

8. 5-6-7 can repeat
9. Wrap Up (optional)
