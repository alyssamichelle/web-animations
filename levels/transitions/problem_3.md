# Problem 3
### Providing More Info
Our button is nice, it gives the User feedback with the current transitions on hover and it also provides Instant Gratification. (The point of the button, and in fact the entire page is short and to the point "BUY GAME") However, it would be nice at this point to also provide more information about the game, like how much it costs.

# Solution
### We can use transitions to animate in the cost on hover!
