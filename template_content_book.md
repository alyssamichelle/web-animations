1. Title
The title of the course.

2. Welcome
Welcome people to the course, introduce yourself.

3. History (optional)
If needed, can give a history of where ____ came from, how it got started, why we are using it now.

4. Final State of App
Start the course off by showing what you are going to create by the end. Explain the app at a very high level and click through it a bit. If this is not the first section, then here is where you often will show the state of the application where we left off.

5. Problem

  - list of steps
  - mini problems (have Jon explain more)

6. Concept
7. Solution
8. Wrap Up

5-6-7 can repeat
6 is optional and used when the problem is complicated enough that showing it at the conceptual level would be helpful for students to understand what's going on


Users, like players on game board, must be guided.

We guide Users through, what could be treacherous User Experience waters, to what hopefully is, a beautiful, calming and successful experience.

On the Interwebs, we have things like CSS Animations to help aide us in guiding Users.

For example, on our WYSIT game site, our Users will have multiple goals set out before them — Understanding the game, Purchasing the game, and communicating with other game players.

It is our job as the web designer to distinguish *which* of these goals are most important to our User and create a UI that will guide them to that goal.

Purchasing the Game is top priority. IF the User does not own the game, how can they play it or commun with other players?

We can Use CSS Transitions to make buying the game a prominent call to action on our page. Then once they have selected that call to action, we can again use CSS Transitions to bring the purchase form on screen smoothly and with a subtle flair.

Using animations on a site not only guides the user and gives them feedback, but it also adds personality to a site. If you can bring a spark of joy or wonder to a User — or even perhaps a small smile, you have won. They will be more open to ideas and more forgiving to bugs. There is no better place to have a User.


So let us begin -

## USing CSS Transitions to create a Prominent CAll to Action
## USing CSS Transitions to bring a form on screen
## USing CSS Transitions to bring an overlay

## Form things at this point


1. title
2. welcome
3. final site we are building
(transition) but we need to start small
4. product pg with a CTA (problem)
- at this point animations are not there (Why)
- we need to call the users attention to the main call to action and also provide them feedback that this is clickable
5. Solution change color of btn on hover
- when we are changing transitions we are changing values from one value to another
- `.button { transition: background-color 2s; }`
  - animated arrows come in and explain syntax
6. Another example
7. In fact this follows the syntax you will see here with transitions
8. we just looked at three things that can be trans. what all properties can be transitioned
- exp. how to determine on your what can be transitioned
- check out whatever.com to see the up to date list
last. now if you went searching for transition you might notice this last opt propterty called delay, not the best idea why

List of Constraints
Level 1 need:
- My example: CTA on a product page
everything will be ok though as long as I have:
- Distilled [drawing attention to the element as the user interacts with it]


- pngs
- svg
- show the power of animating an svg vs png


History: might fit in well with the SVG level
