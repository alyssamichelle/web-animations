**Content Lead: Alyssa Nicoll; Content Reviewer: Jon Friskics**

## [Google Doc for Outline](https://docs.google.com/a/codeschool.com/document/d/1IIgW45Y-L5L4b3sL4qItYSARL0HdSj5fGfXibY4elis/edit#heading=h.8wiq8i73khw3)

## Course Type & Theme
There will be two separate apps but structurally the same. One will be used for slides and the other for challenges. All the CSS Animations will be practiced and used in UI elements on the sites.

### Theme Suggestion
Suggested Course Title: Subtle CSS Animations

###Example Apps
The example app will be a site with 2-3 pages. The different elements on each page will be there to support the different types of animations and concepts taught in this course.  Here are some examples of the kinds of things that might be animating on the site:
button (change gradient)
- drop down to animate: http://codepen.io/alyssamichelle/pen/JoeeyZ
- modal to animate in with keyframes (level 1)
- Animating Icons
- collapsible nav
